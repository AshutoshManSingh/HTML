    <h2>Lumbini</h2>
    <p>LumbinÄ«is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Lumbini Province in Nepal. 
        It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Mahamayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha
         Gautama at around 563 BCE. Gautama, who, according to Buddhist tradition, achieved 
         Enlightenment some time around 528 BCE, became the Buddha and founded Buddhism. Lumbini is 
         one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha.
        Lumbini has a number of older temples, including the Mayadevi Temple, and various new temples, 
        funded by Buddhist organisations from various countries, have been completed or are still under 
        construction. Many monuments, monasteries and a museum, and the Lumbini International Research 
        Institute are also within the holy site. Also, there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where the 
        Buddha's mother took the ritual dip prior to his birth and where he had his first bath. At other 
        sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born, then achieved ultimate 
        Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms.Lumbini was made a World Heritage Site 
        by UNESCO in 1997.</p>
